- 👋 Hello, I’m @91Michal91


👀 I’m interested in programming languages, automatization, AI,psychology and motorization.

🌱 I’m currently learning Django.
 💞️
  My adventure with programming started from Python than Java Script and C# in University.
  I decided to learn Python and Django more  because I like it. 
  I am heading to know better Django, React and a lot more.
  So I want to be a full stack dev in the future.
